-- In this project, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 
Link to sample database: https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvsasmtr8syq2c2/BIT_DB?e=1&dl=0

1) -- How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

Answer: 9681

2) -- How many of those were iPhones?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone'

3) -- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

4) -- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, location, SUM(price)*quantity AS revenue, SUM(quantity) AS total
FROM  BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

Answer: AA Batteries (4 pack), two were sold, with a revenue of $7.68

5) -- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID' 

Answer: 278 customers, averaging $13.83
