## For this project, I used the Walmart E-commerce Product Dataset on Kaggle, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hikageshinomori/walmart-e-commerce-product-data

-- 1) What is the cheapest beverage that has an average rating over 3 and at least 100 reviews?

This query shows the title, price, average rating, and review count of the highest-rated beverage with at least 100 reviews from the Sales.walmart table, sorted by price in ascending order.

For businesses, this information is helpful because it can:

Identify popular products, optimize pricing, and enhance marketing.

First, I focus on 'Beverages' to narrow down my search to relevant products. Then, I make sure I'm only looking at items with 100 or more reviews to get reliable feedback. 
I filter out any products with an average rating below 3 and remove any entries with missing or invalid ratings to keep my data clean. 
Next, I sort these products by price from lowest to highest and pick the cheapest one that meets all the criteria, helping to find an affordable and popular beverage.


SELECT title, price, avg_rating, reviews_count
FROM Sales.walmart 
WHERE sub_category_1 = 'Beverages' 
  AND reviews_count >= 100
  AND avg_rating >= 3
  AND avg_rating IS NOT NULL
  AND avg_rating <> ''
  AND avg_rating <> ' '
  ORDER BY price ASC
  LIMIT 1

-- 2) Identify the top 10 most expensive items in stock.

This helps business because by identifying high-priced items, they can gain insights into premium products that can potentially drive higher revenue.

In this query, I filter out null or empty price values, trim any leading or trailing whitespace, and then convert prices to a numeric type for accurate sorting. 
Then, I order the items by price in descending order and limit the results to the top 10 most expensive products, to highlight the top items in the inventory.

SELECT title, price
FROM Sales.walmart
WHERE price IS NOT NULL
  AND TRIM(price) <> ''
ORDER BY CAST(TRIM(price) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) DESC
LIMIT 10

-- 3) What is the average price of an item in the "Bath & Body" category?
This helps businesses by setting competitive prices for new or existing products and allows them to make informed decisions on stocking products based on average prices.

In this query, I calculated the average price of the items, aliasing it so that it would be easier to read, and then 
filtered it to only include items that were in the category "Bath & Body". 

SELECT AVG(price) AS body_product_average_price
FROM Sales.walmart
WHERE sub_category_1 = 'Bath & Body'

-- 4) What are the SKUs, prices, and names of all the razor products sorted from cheapest to most expensive?
This helps businesses manage stock and inventory, as well as identify pricing patterns for potential adjustment.

In this query, I selected the title, price, and sku number. Then I used the "LIKE" function to filter the results to anything containing the word "razor". 
Finally, I ordered it by ascending price to see the cheapest items first and the most expensive items last.

SELECT DISTINCT title, price, sku
FROM Sales.walmart
WHERE title LIKE "%razor%"
ORDER BY price
