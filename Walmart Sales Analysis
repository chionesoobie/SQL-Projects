For this project, I used the Walmart E-commerce Product Dataset on Kaggle, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hikageshinomori/walmart-e-commerce-product-data

-- 1) What is the cheapest beverage that has an average rating over 3 and at least 100 reviews?

This query shows the title, price, average rating, and review count of the highest-rated beverage with at least 100 reviews from the Sales.walmart table, sorted by price in ascending order.

For businesses, this information is helpful because it can:

Identify popular products, optimize pricing, and enhance marketing.

First, I focus on 'Beverages' to narrow down my search to relevant products. Then, I make sure I'm only looking at items with 100 or more reviews to get reliable feedback. 
I filter out any products with an average rating below 3 and remove any entries with missing or invalid ratings to keep my data clean. 
Next, I sort these products by price from lowest to highest and pick the cheapest one that meets all the criteria, helping to find an affordable and popular beverage.


SELECT title, price, avg_rating, reviews_count
FROM Sales.walmart 
WHERE sub_category_1 = 'Beverages' 
  AND reviews_count >= 100
  AND avg_rating >= 3
  AND avg_rating IS NOT NULL
  AND avg_rating <> ''
  AND avg_rating <> ' '
  ORDER BY price ASC
  LIMIT 1

-- 2) Identify the top 10 most expensive items in stock.

This helps business because by identifying high-priced items, they can gain insights into premium products that can potentially drive higher revenue.

In this query, I filter out null or empty price values, trim any leading or trailing whitespace, and then convert prices to a numeric type for accurate sorting. 
Then, I orderthe items by price in descending order and limit the results to the top 10 most expensive products, to highlight the top items in the inventory.

SELECT title, price
FROM Sales.walmart
WHERE price IS NOT NULL
  AND TRIM(price) <> ''
ORDER BY CAST(TRIM(price) AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) DESC
LIMIT 10
